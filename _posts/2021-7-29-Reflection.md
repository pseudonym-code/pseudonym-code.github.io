This post will be a reflection on this Data Science [blog post](https://pseudonym-code.github.io/Data-Science/) from May 24, 2021.


### What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?
As a data scientist myself, I don't think that anything has really changed about how I view the role of data scientist. This course has helped me to understand more of the tools available to me as a data scientist though. To boil down the role into one sentence, I will take a sentence from my earlier post. "Being a data scientist is about taking data and telling a story with it." I think this really narrows it down, as throughout the many industries, disciplines, and roles that data scientists are in, this mission is the same. 

### What are your current thoughts in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?
I love using R, and I have already learned so much from this course despite using it almost daily in my current role. There are definitely things that I used in this course that I have already implemented into my current development practices, and there will be more to come as I continue to expand and truly build out my portfolio. As I mentioned in [Project 1](https://pseudonym-code.github.io/Project1/) for this course, I hope to continue to post things like the vignette the project produced on this blog. Understanding the capabilities behind R and GitHub has been a real positive from this entire course. I plan to continue to learn and post tutorials and lessons on this GitHub account at least monthly, if not weekly.

### What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?
I have already begun using GitHub in my everyday work to track changes to repositories among my team. This has allowed for easier change tracking and improved efficiency. It also helps with the version control to understand what changes were made when and an easy way to revert to an old version if needed. I also, as mentioned above, plan to continue this blog and post different tutorials on R to continue learning myself. I never really used tidyverse much before this class, and I plan to learn as much as I can to implement it into my own code. 
  
Overall, this course has been a great stepping stone in my data science career that I hope to use to boost both my personal and professional knowledge of R, statistics, and data science as a whole.
