title: Thoughts About Data Science
---
Data Science is a term that has grown to mean many things, especially in the business world. There tends to be a blurred line between statistics, business intelligence, computer science, and data science. In the end, all of these distinct fields are often grouped into the data science realm. In this blog post, I will go through a couple questions specific to the job role of a data scientist and attempt to shed some light on this particular field in my own opinion. 

What do you think being a data scientist is about? 

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
