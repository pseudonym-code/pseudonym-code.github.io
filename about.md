I am currently an analytics consultant and data science development lead at IBM and have been for almost two years. I currently work in the Procurement group and provide analytics as a service to multiple Fortune 500 clients. I am a BYU graduate with a degree in Statistics and am currently pursuing a Master's degree in the same field at North Carolina State University.

### Work History and Past Projects  

Before IBM, I was able to intern with a company called Just Data in Utah. There, I served as a Machine Learning Intern working with Adoption.com to create a recommender system for prospective parents. The main goal was to take previous adoption data, look at successful past adoptions, and pair prospective parents with children that needed homes. This was a very interesting project that required a lot of data cleansing and manipulation, as well as multiple models to find the best fit.  

My Senior year at university, I also completed a Data Science Capstone Project. As a team, created an artificial intelligence "salesman" for low-end items such as TVs, Financial Services, things that are very simple to sell. This required a multitude of natural language processing methods as well as extensive work with audio data. The entire process included taking real-time input from a user in the form of audio data, processing that information, and returning the output text as speech. 

At BYU I had multiple jobs through my four years. I was a teaching assistant for two courses, the first being a course in Advanced Regression, and the second a course on Advanced Business Analytics in Excel. Much of my time in these positions was spent holding open office hours to teach hard concepts to students that were struggling. I also debugged programs and taught R Programming outside of class.  

### Education History

I am currently completing my Master's in Statistics at NC State and will graduate in August of 2021. Before my Master's, I studied Statistics at Brigham Young University, where I graduated with a 3.9 GPA. During my undergrad program, I also pursued minors in Psychology, Mathematics, and Business Management. I also took multiple Computer Science courses and have a strong coding background that I continue to build upon each day.
